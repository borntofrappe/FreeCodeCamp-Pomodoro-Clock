# The Task 

Following up the JavaScript Calculator, this project conitnues with the advanced, front-end challenges in the main curriculum @freecodecamp.

The task is to implement a pomodoro clock: set a timer for how much you want to work, set a timer for how much you want to take a break, start the clock. When the clock reaches 0, it begins the break time, at the end of which it repeats the described behavior.

The specific user stories to fulfill are:

- [ ] I can start a 25 minute pomodoro, at the end of which the timer will go off;
- [ ] I can reset the clock to set another pomodoro;
- [ ] I can alter the length of each pomodoro.

One pomodoro being the sum of work and break time.

# Versions

Instead of jotting down few pointers regarding the plan, or how I plan to tackle the project at hand, I decided to create the pomodoro clock in versions. Starting with a bare-bone webpage and progressively build features one at a time.
